Broad
 
Area
 
of
 
Work
 This project is situa ted in the broad area of Applied Artificial Intelligence and AIOp s (AI 
for
 
IT
 
Oper ations).
 
It
 
involves
 
the
 
practic al
 
applic ation
 
of
 
several
 
key
 
resear ch
 
fields
 
to
 
solve
 
a
 
signific ant
 
enterprise-le vel
 
problem:
 
●
 
Natural
 
Languag e
 
Processing
 
(NLP):
 
To
 
under stand
 
user -report ed
 
issues
 
from
 
chat
 
logs
 
and
 
inciden t
 
tickets
 
and
 
to
 
perform
 
seman tic
 
matching.
 
●
 
Vector
 
Sear ch
 
&
 
Informa tion
 
Retrieval:
 
To
 
build
 
a
 
high-speed
 
"seman tic
 
sear ch"
 
engine
 
that
 
finds
 
similar
 
historical
 
solutions
 
from
 
a
 
large
 
dataset.
 
●
 
Machine
 
Learning
 
(Clus tering
 
&
 
Classific ation):
 
To
 
analy ze
 
inciden t
 
data,
 
automa tically
 
detect
 
recurring
 
patterns,
 
and
 
classif y
 
issues.
 
2.
 
Backgr ound
 In man y large-scale organizations like Verizon, IT support and customer service teams 
are
 
a
 
critic al
 
function.
 
However,
 
they
 
are
 
often
 
overwhelmed
 
by
 
a
 
high
 
volume
 
of
 
repetitive
 
inciden ts.
 
A
 
large
 
percentage
 
of
 
support
 
tickets
 
are
 
for
 
known
 
issues
 
that
 
have
 
been
 
solved
 
before.
 
The
 
"tribal
 
knowledg e"
 
requir ed
 
to
 
solve
 
these
 
issues
 
is
 
often
 
lost
 
in
 
historical
 
inciden t
 
logs,
 
old
 
chat
 
transcrip ts,
 
or
 
dispar ate
 
Knowledg e
 
Base
 
(KB)
 
articles.
 
This
 
leads
 
to
 
high
 
Mean
 
Time
 
To
 
Resolution
 
(MTTR),
 
frustrated
 
user s,
 
and
 
inefficien t
 
support
 
teams.
 The relevance of this project to the studen t's work environmen t (Verizon) is the direct 
applic ation
 
of
 
AI
 
to
 
optimiz e
 
this
 
exact
 
process.
 
The
 
proposed
 
solution
 
is
 
a
 
Proof
 
of
 
Concep t
 
(PoC)
 
for
 
an
 
"Intellig ent
 
Inciden t
 
Resolution
 
&
 
Autoheal
 
Frame work"
 
(IIRAF)
,
 
which
 
will
 
serve
 
as
 
the
 
AI-driv en
 
self-service
 
tool.
 
By
 
integrating
 
with
 
existing
 
ticketing
 
systems,
 
the
 
IIRAF
 
frame work
 
can
 
act
 
as
 
an
 
intelligent
 
layer.
 
It
 
will
 
use
 
the
 
provided
 
synthetic
 
dataset
 
(which
 
mirr ors
 
real-w orld
 
inciden t
 
data)
 
to
 
build
 
a
 
system
 
that
 
can
 
proactiv ely
 
assis t
 
support
 
agents,
 
automa te
 
resolutions
 
for
 
common
 
patterns,
 
and
 
create
 
a
 
"self -healing"
 
system
 
that
 
continuously
 
learns,
 
thereby
 
directly
 
addr essing
 
these
 
key
 
business
 
inefficiencies.

Objectiv es
 The primar y objectiv e is to design, develop, and valida te a Proof of Concep t (PoC) for 
the
 
AI-driv en
 
self-service
 
tool,
 
referred
 
to
 
as
 
the
 
Intelligent
 
Inciden t
 
Resolution
 
&
 
Autoheal
 
Frame work
 
(IIRAF).
 The specific objectiv es are: 
1.
 
To
 
design
 
the
 
comple te
 
architectur e
 
for
 
an
 
end-t o-end
 
inciden t
 
resolution
 
frame work,
 
including
 
data
 
ingestion,
 
seman tic
 
sear ch,
 
pattern
 
detection,
 
and
 
an
 
auto-heal
 
execution
 
module.
 
2.
 
To
 
implemen t
 
a
 
seman tic
 
sear ch
 
engine
 
using
 
NLP
 
(Sen tenceT ransformer s)
 
and
 
a
 
vector
 
database
 
(FAISS)
 
to
 
match
 
new
 
issues
 
against
 
historical
 
inciden ts
 
and
 
knowledg e
 
base
 
articles.
 
3.
 
To
 
build
 
a
 
pattern
 
detection
 
module
 
that
 
analy zes
 
inciden t
 
data
 
to
 
iden tify
 
frequen tly
 
recurring
 
issues
 
and
 
group
 
them
 
into
 
actionable
 
"patterns".
 
4.
 
To
 
develop
 
an
 
"Aut oheal
 
Execut or"
 
that
 
can
 
map
 
valida ted
 
patterns
 
to
 
a
 
reposit ory
 
of
 
automa tion
 
actions
 
for
 
simula ted,
 
no-touch
 
resolution.
 
5.
 
To
 
deliv er
 
a
 
full-s tack
 
PoC,
 
including
 
a
 
FastAPI
 
back end
 
API
 
and
 
a
 
React -based
 
 
--- Page 4 ---
 
frontend, that demons trates the end-t o-end workflo w on the provided 
synthetic
 
dataset.

Scope
 
of
 
Work
 The scope of this project is the developmen t of a functional Proof of Concep t (PoC) to 
be
 
comple ted
 
independen tly
 
by
 
the
 
studen t.
 In Scope: 
●
 
Data:
 
The
 
project
 
will
 
exclusiv ely
 
use
 
the
 
provided
 
synthetic
 
dataset
 
(Inciden t_His tory.csv,
 
Chat_Transcrip ts.cs v,
 
KB_Articles.cs v,
 
etc.).
 
●
 
Back end:
 
Developmen t
 
of
 
a
 
comple te
 
Python-based
 
FastAPI
 
server
 
to
 
host
 
all
 
core
 
logic,
 
ML
 
models,
 
and
 
API
 
endpoin ts.
 
●
 
Seman tic
 
Sear ch:
 
Building
 
a
 
FAISS
 
vector
 
inde x
 
from
 
the
 
inciden t
 
and
 
KB
 
data.
 
●
 
Pattern
 
Detection:
 
Implemen ting
 
ML
 
or
 
rule-based
 
logic
 
to
 
iden tify
 
patterns
 
from
 
the
 
data
 
files.
 
●
 
Frontend:
 
Developmen t
 
of
 
a
 
React -based
 
web
 
interface
 
to
 
sear ch
 
for
 
inciden ts,
 
view
 
patterns,
 
and
 
simula te
 
auto-heal
 
actions.
 
●
 
Simula tion:
 
Auto-heal
 
actions
 
will
 
be
 
simula ted
.
 
The
 
system
 
will
 
log
 
the
 
"action"
 
that
 
would
 
have
 
been
 
taken
 
(e.g.,
 
"Simula ted
 
execution:
 
restart_pa ymen t_gateway.sh")
 
rather
 
than
 
executing
 
any
 
real
 
scrip ts.
 Out of Scope: 
●
 
This
 
project
 
is
 
a
 
PoC
 
and
 
will
 
not
 
be
 
deplo yed
 
in
 
a
 
live
 
production
 
environmen t.
 
●
 
The
 
frame work
 
will
 
not
 
connect
 
to
 
live
 
enterprise
 
ticketing
 
systems
 
(e.g.,
 
a
 
real
 
ServiceNo w
 
instance).
 
All
 
interactions
 
are
 
with
 
the
 
provided
 
CSV
 
datasets.
 
●
 
The
 
system
 
will
 
not
 
perform
 
real-time
 
data
 
ingestion;
 
it
 
will
 
be
 
pre-loaded
 
with
 
the
 
dataset
 
at
 
startup.
 
●
 
The
 
MLOps
 
integration
 
(
 
Continuous
 
Training
 
of
 
model)
  
has
 
been
 
brough t
 
out
 
of
 
scope
 
due
 
to
 
the
 
exhaus tive
 
effort
 
involved
 
and
 
the
 
time
 
available
 
as
 
discussed
 
with
 
Dhuruba
 
Adhik ary
 
sir.
