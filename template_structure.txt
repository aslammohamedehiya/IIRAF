1. Abstract Summary  1.1 Project Overview  The AI-Based Customer Journe y Analy zer is a modular , full-s tack applic ation designed to analy ze 
comple x
 
customer
 
interaction
 
logs
 
across
 
multiple
 
channels.
 
It
 
uses
 
unsuper vised
 
machine
 
learning
 
(K-Means
 
Clustering)
 
and
 
Natural
 
Languag e
 
Processing
 
(NLP)
 
to
 
segmen t
 
customer s
 
based
 
on
 
their
 
beha vior
 
patterns
 
and
 
provide
 
actionable
 
insigh ts
 
into
 
their
 
journe y.
  1.2 Problem Statemen t  Organizations often struggle to synthesiz e vast amoun ts of heterogeneous interaction data (Web, 
App,
 
Call
 
Center,
 
etc.)
 
into
 
a
 
coher ent
 
under standing
 
of
 
customer
 
loyalty
 
and
 
friction.
 
Manual
 
analy sis
 
is
 
slow,
 
and
 
simple
 
rule-based
 
systems
 
fail
 
to
 
capture
 
nuanced
 
beha vioral
 
shifts,
 
leading
 
to
 
missed
 
opportunities
 
for
 
proactiv e
 
retention
 
and
 
service
 
impr ovemen t.
  1.3 Key Objectiv e  To provide an automa ted, AI-driv en platform that: 
●
 
Segmen t
 
customer s
 
into
 
meaningful
 
loyalty
 
tiers
 
using
 
objectiv e
 
beha vioral
 
features.
 
●
 
Quan tifies
 
customer
 
friction
 
and
 
interaction
 
quality .
 
●
 
Gener ates
 
human-r eadable
 
summaries
 
of
 
comple x
 
customer
 
journe ys
 
using
 
LLMs.
 
●
 
Offers
 
an
 
interactiv e
 
dashboar d
 
for
 
both
 
individual
 
customer
 
look ups
 
and
 
high-le vel
 
system
 
monit oring.
    2. Technical Architecture 
2.1 Project Workspace Architectur e 
The system is organized into a modular , decoupled structur e to ensur e scalability and ease of 
main tenance.
 
Core
 
logic
 
is
 
centralized
 
within
 
the
 
src/
 
directory
 
to
 
be
 
shar ed
 
across
 
both
 
the
 
back end
 
API
 
and
 
standalone
 
training
 
scrip ts.
 
●
 
app/ — Deliv ery Layer 
○
 
main.py: FastAPI back end managing asynchr onous endpoin ts for data processing 
and
 
model
 
look ups.
 
○
 
dashboard.py: Streamlit -based frontend providing interactiv e journe y mapping 
and
 
cohort
 
visualiz ations.
 
●
 
src/ — Logic & Analy tics Layer 
○
 
data_generator.py: Logic for simula ting comple x customer interaction logs 
across
 
multiple
 
channels.
 
○
 
preprocessing.py: Data cleaning and feature engineering , including Time-Dec ay
